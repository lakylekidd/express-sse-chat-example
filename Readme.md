# Chat App
In this repo I will attempt to demonstrate how to build a chat app using expressJS, server-side events with custom authentication and connect it to a reactjs front end app.

## Technologies Used
For this example, we will be using the following technologies:
* Express
* Cors
* Body Parser
* Jsonwebtoken
* Sequelize with PG
* PostgreSQL
* React / Redux

## Follow the Articles
I will be breaking down these examples into parts. You can follow the articles and checkout the branch for each part individually, for example:
```
git checkout part1
```
